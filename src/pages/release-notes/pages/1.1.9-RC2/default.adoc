= 1.1.9-RC2 Release Notes

* **General Changes**
** Minor Bug Fixes includes the following:
*** Addition of lombok.config properties file to nimbus-core project with properties to generate @ConstructorProperties. This fixes the issue of parsing ExecuteOutput which was causing a JSON parser issue after upgrading spring-boot version to 1.5.13.RELEASE. lombok v1.16.20 requires the below new property to generate @ConstructorProperties.

```
lombok.anyConstructor.addConstructorProperties=true
config.stopBubbling = true
```
