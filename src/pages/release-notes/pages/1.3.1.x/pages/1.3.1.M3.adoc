* **Bug Fixes**
** Fixed an issue where `@Link` was intermittently throwing a non-breaking console error in the browser https://github.com/openanthem/nimbus-core/pull/548[#548]
** Fixed a styling issue where `@CardDetail` in `@GridRowBody` was causing incorrect text wrapping https://github.com/openanthem/nimbus-core/pull/546[#546]
** Fixed an issue with `@Grid` where loading of the data was sometimes not showing the loader icon https://github.com/openanthem/nimbus-core/pull/543[#543]
*** `@Grid` will now always show it's own custom loader icon until the data refresh is done. The loader icon can be configured via the `Grid.loaderIcon` attribute.
