@Rule allows its decorated field a mechanism for triggering one or more rule definitions during its OnStateLoad and OnStateChange events.

.SampleRuleEntity.java
----
@Domain(value="sample_rule_entity", includeListeners={ListenerType.persistence})
@Repo(Database.rep_mongodb)
@Getter @Setter
public class SampleRuleEntity {

	// Execute the rule at "rules/sample_increment" during the OnStateLoad and
	// OnStateChange events of ruleParam.
	@Rule("rules/sample_increment")
	private String rule_param;
}
----

By default, the framework provides support for firing all rules for a given domain entity. That is, for the *SampleRuleEntity.java* above we might have a rule file defined as *sample_rule_entity.drl* which will be automatically fired by naming convention.

For cases where additional configuration for other rules is needed, @Rule can be used.
