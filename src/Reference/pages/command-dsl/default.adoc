= The Command Query DSL

The _Command_ is the instruction that the Framework understands to execute and come back with an output. It is similar to writing the traditional method calls for an action (such as a button click) to perform business logic, but attempts to introduce a standardized process via the use of a domain specific language (DSL) that the Framework can interpret. This is called the Command Query DSL.

The Command Query DSL is represented in URL format (commonly referred to as the _Command URL_) and is based on http://www.querydsl.com/[Query DSL].

Apart from the _host_ (typical "host", or provider, of the application utilizing the Framework), the DSL's Command URL can be broken down into four main subsections of: 

* **Client-alias** - _identification path used to segregate data/logic for one or multiple "clients". Supports clientCode, leaf-org-id, and appAlias_
* **Domain-alias** - _identification path within the framework to locate a defined object, or domain entity_
* **Action** - _instruction used to identify the operation to perform on the object identified by domain-root_
* **Query Parameters** - _A standard set of query parameters_

The following diagram shows each of the subsections of the Command Query DSL mentioned above in various examples in an "exploded" view:

In the diagram above, several examples of Command URL's can be seen. By splitting the URL into it's individual parts, the diagram represents each of the Command URL's as a vertical section. Requests sent to the Framework using each of these URLs perform different logic as defined by the Framework. The sections that follow will explain the logic defined for each of the individual subections of the Command URL as well as expain the Command Query DSL in-depth.
